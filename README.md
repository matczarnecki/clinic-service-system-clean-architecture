# Clinic Service System - Clean Architecture

## Goals 

The main goal of this project is to learn and implement a clean architecture (hexagonal architecture)
for my previous application that I developed with my teammates to pass the university classes.

In the future I am going to add tests and redux to the frontend layer.

## Original project

The original version of the app can be found under:
